# In the beginning was...the cyberpartment

The first website I ever built was a virtual apartment, or *cyberpartment* as I termed it, that I showed off to a handful of friends. None of this involved JavaScript, of course, because I either hadn't learned it yet or it was unable to achieve what I wanted it to do (Both?). It's been 18 years, so the details of this endeavour are vague, but in essence my little cyberpartment was a collection of HTML pages linked to each other in some manner. Each page was a different room in the virtual apartment, and to enter one, you simply click on a graphic of a door.

On the home page, visitors would be greeted by the image of a door I had clearly made in MS Paint. Clicking on that "opened" the "apartment", or to put it in a much more banal way, brought you to the next page I'd coded up. There was even a window in one of these "rooms". What I put in these "rooms" I can unfortunately no longer remember, but perhaps that is to everyone's benefit (to be spared of my cringiest years).

I was particularly proud of this very basic website because it was being hosted on a web server I set up on our shared family PC running Windows. I configured [KF Web Server](http://www.keyfocus.net/kfws/)  to serve the pages up to the public because I was 12 or 13 and blissfully unaware of security practices...and I was also probably running afoul of our ISP's terms of service by running a web server.

But none of that mattered to me because I had a web presence at last, and one that impressed my friends.

## The Great White Way on the Web

Soon after I explored the world of other HTTP servers (Apache, which intimidated me, Microsoft Personal Web Server, which seemed a lot easier to use I suppose), the conveniences of WYSIWYG web page editors, and the quirky character of Geocities pages, I became enamored with musical theatre and all things Broadway/Off-Broadway/West End/Off-West End (I was far too pretentious at the time to acknowledge that regional and community theatre can be just as incredible).

My closest friends in meatspace for the most part did not appreciate the art of musical theatre, so I turned to online communities that lived in PHP-based forums to find my niche of people. I was pleased to find many (at least 5) other people who shared my passion for Sondheim, Wicked, Les Miserables, The Drowsy Chaperone...

Like many fans, I had even entertained the possibility of becoming an actor in musical theatre but soon learned that such a career required much patience, discipline, survival on very little money, hours upon hours of practice, actual acting and singing ability...
