# Definition

There does not seem to be a _general_ consensus on this, but I will say that I consider a digital garden to be any text-based resource that links data together in a non-linear way through hyperlinking, with the express purpose of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) and/or links bits of information together to create a network of thoughts.

# Apps

- [[Obsidian]] - This is what I use now to write for this site.
- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) - I haven't tried this, but it's often cited as a tool for maintaining a digital garden.
- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) I had one of these for note-taking when I was in college, before I was aware of the concept of a digital garden.
