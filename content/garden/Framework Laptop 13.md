I recently got a [Framework Laptop 13 DIY Edition](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-intel) to replace my Thinkpad T480 and System76 Adder WS 1. Here are some notes on installation, general thoughts.

# What's in the box

This is what I received for my pre-order. 

NOTE: Mine did not come with memory and storage modules because I already had some to spare.

- Framework screwdriver
- Input kit (keyboard, touchpad)
- Display kit (display, bezel)
- Main board
- Special goodies (stickers, patch for being a pre-order)
- 4 expansion cards:
	- 2 x USB-C
	- 1 x USB-A
	- 1 x HDMI

# What I already had

I took these from my broken System76 addr ws 1 and installed them onto this machine.

- 1TB Samsung NVMe SSD
- 2 x 16GB DDR3 = 32GB

# Assembly

Used the official Framework [guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+13+(13th+Gen+Intel+Core)+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/168?lang=en) for the DIY Edition.

Make sure to connect the input kit cable to motherboard. I wondered for 15 minutes why the laptop wasn't powering on only to realize I hadn't actually connected the keyboard and touchpad to the motherboard. D'oh!

# Operating System

I installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using Framework's [guide](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Ubuntu+22.04+LTS+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop+13/109).
