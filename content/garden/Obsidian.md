Obsidian is markdown-based knowledge base that functions like a wiki . The [official site](https://obsidian.md/) describes it as "a second brain".

Knowledge bases are organized into different vaults, so if you need knowledge bases for different contexts, you'd create a vault for each one. I have a vault for this [[Digital Garden]] and another one for work.

Wiki links look like `[[this]]` in Obsidian, so it's fairly similar to wiki-syntax.
