Obsidian is markdown-based knowledge base that functions like a wiki in that it's non-linear. The [official site](https://obsidian.md/) describes it as "a second brain".

Knowledge bases are organized into different vaults, so if you need knowledge bases for different contexts, you'd create a vault for each one. I have a vault for this [[Digital Garden]] and another one for work.
